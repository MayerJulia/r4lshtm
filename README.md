Welcome to R for LSHTM, 2022 edition. 

This repository collates all of the practical sessions from the statistical course sequence at LSHTM: STEPH, SME, and ASME. Datasets are presently not confirmed to be publicly available, but are available on Moodle for LSHTM staff and students - I am working on clarifying dataset availability or replacing with a simulated dataset for those based outside of LSHTM.



This material is constantly being updated and should be complete by the end of the 2021-2022 academic year.

The mapping of sessions is as follows:

| Course 	| Filename 	                 | Session Number 2022 	| Session Title 2022 	|
|--------	|----------	                 |-----------	      |-------	        |
