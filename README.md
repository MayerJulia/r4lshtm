Welcome to R for LSHTM, 2022 edition. 

This repository collates all of the practical sessions from the statistical course sequence at LSHTM: STEPH, SME, and ASME. Datasets are presently not confirmed to be publicly available, but are available on Moodle for LSHTM staff and students - I am working on clarifying dataset availability or replacing with a simulated dataset for those based outside of LSHTM.

This material is constantly being updated and should be complete by the end of the 2021-2022 academic year.

The mapping of sessions is as follows:

| Course 	| Filename 	| Session Number 	| Session Title 	|
|--------	|----------	|-----------	|-------	|
| STEPH   | prac01_means          	|           	|       	|
|        	| prac02_categorical         	|           	|       	|
|        	| prac03_strat2x2         	|           	|       	|
|        	| prac04_linreg         	|           	|       	|
|        	| prac05_extlinreg         	|           	|       	|
|--------	|----------	|-----------	|-------	|
| SME     | prac01_survival          	|           	|       	|
|         | prac02_case-control          	|           	|       	|
|         | prac03_logistic          	|           	|       	|
|         | prac04_logistic-covariates          	|           	|       	|
|--------	|----------	|-----------	|-------	|
| ASME    | prac01_classical          	|           	|       	|
