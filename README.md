Welcome to R for LSHTM, 2022 edition. 

This repository collates all of the practical sessions from the statistical course sequence at LSHTM: STEPH, SME, and ASME. Datasets are presently not confirmed to be publicly available, but are available on Moodle for LSHTM staff and students - I am working on clarifying dataset availability or replacing with a simulated dataset for those based outside of LSHTM.

This material is constantly being updated and should be complete by the end of the 2021-2022 academic year. If you are working with these files and notice any changes that need to be made, or if you wish to add R files for any other courses at LSHTM, please do [make a pull request](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github).

The mapping of sessions is as follows:
